# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project  

This repository contains an R script, and a code book which are requirements for the Peer Graded Assignment of the Getting and Cleaning Data course on the John Hopkins Data Science Specialization.

## Files
* Raw dataset [Link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 

* `Codebook.md` file which describes the data, variables and transformations performed to    clean up the data

* `run_analysis.R` script which does the following:
    + Merges the training and test sets to create one data set
    + Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each                 measurement
    + Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    + Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
    + Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for          each activity and each subject

* `tidyData.txt` which contains the second tidy dataset as described above
